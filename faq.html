        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">How do I select my favorite brands?</p>
            <p class="answer">Go to the Fav tab and tap on any brand to toggle it as a favorite. Your favorites will be announced as you approach them and shown on the map.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">Does RoadVoice work with navigation apps?</p>
            <p class="answer">Yes! RoadVoice works best alongside Waze or Google Maps. The announcements will play over your navigation audio.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">How do I import my own locations?</p>
            <p class="answer">Tap the menu (☰) on the Home screen and select "Import Custom POIs". Upload a CSV file with columns: name, lat, lon (and optionally city, state, street_address).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">Why don't I hear announcements?</p>
            <p class="answer">Make sure announcing is turned ON (green "Start Announcing" button on Home screen). Also check that the speed gate setting isn't blocking announcements when you're moving slowly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">How far ahead does RoadVoice look for POIs?</p>
            <p class="answer">You can configure this in Settings. The default is 5 miles ahead, but you can set it anywhere from 1 to 20 miles.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">Does RoadVoice drain my battery?</p>
            <p class="answer">RoadVoice uses GPS which does use battery, but it's similar to using any navigation app. For long trips, we recommend keeping your phone plugged in.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">Where does the POI data come from?</p>
            <p class="answer">POI data comes from AllThePlaces.xyz, an open-source project that collects location data from brand websites. The data is licensed under CC-0 (public domain). Additional data comes from the National Park Service API and other public sources.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">Why is a store or brand missing from the app?</p>
            <p class="answer">RoadVoice includes over 300 brands and 320,000+ locations, but we can't cover every business. A brand might be missing if: (1) it's not in our data sources yet, (2) it's a local or regional chain we haven't added, or (3) it's a new location that opened recently. You can always import your own locations using the "Import Custom POIs" feature.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">There's a McDonald's (or other store) near me that's not showing up. Why?</p>
            <p class="answer">Our data comes from publicly available sources and may not be 100% complete. New locations, recently renovated stores, or locations in certain areas might be missing. The data is updated periodically, but there can be gaps. If a specific location is important to you, you can add it manually using the Import Custom POIs feature.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">A location is shown but it's closed or doesn't exist anymore. What gives?</p>
            <p class="answer">Location data can become outdated when stores close, relocate, or rebrand. Our data sources are updated periodically, but there's always some lag between real-world changes and database updates. We're working on improving data freshness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">How often is the POI data updated?</p>
            <p class="answer">We update the POI database with each app release, typically every few weeks. However, the underlying data sources (like AllThePlaces) update on their own schedules, so there may be some delay between when a location opens or closes and when it appears in the app.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">Can I report missing or incorrect locations?</p>
            <p class="answer">Yes! Use the "Contact Support" option in the app menu, or email us at roadvoiceapp@gmail.com. Please include your device info (the app can copy this for you) and details about the issue.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">How do I contact support?</p>
            <p class="answer">Tap the menu (☰) on the Home screen and select "Contact Support". You'll see our email address and your device info, which you can copy and paste into your email app. You can also email us directly at roadvoiceapp@gmail.com.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">Can I use RoadVoice in Canada?</p>
            <p class="answer">Yes! RoadVoice includes POI data for both the United States and Canada.</p>

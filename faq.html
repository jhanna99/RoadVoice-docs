        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">How do I select my favorite brands?</p>
            <p class="answer">Go to the Fav tab and tap on any brand to toggle it as a favorite. Your favorites will be announced as you approach them and shown on the map.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">Does RoadVoice work with navigation apps?</p>
            <p class="answer">Yes! RoadVoice works best alongside Waze or Google Maps. The announcements will play over your navigation audio.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">How do I import my own locations?</p>
            <p class="answer">Tap the menu (☰) on the Home screen and select "Import Custom POIs". Upload a CSV file with columns: name, lat, lon (and optionally city, state, street_address).</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">Why don't I hear announcements?</p>
            <p class="answer">Make sure announcing is turned ON (green "Start Announcing" button on Home screen). Also check that the speed gate setting isn't blocking announcements when you're moving slowly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">How far ahead does RoadVoice look for POIs?</p>

            <p class="question">Does RoadVoice drain my battery?</p>
